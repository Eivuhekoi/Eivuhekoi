Greetings people!

I'm Ikoinufe Eivuhekoi!  
Worldbuilder, coder\*, short-story writer and a dozen million other labels for all the hobbies I've tried and given up on!

I mainly use GitHub to distribute my worldbuilding project "A Shattered World", and occasionally some of the Emacs stuff I've made for personal use.

Eivuhekoi/Eivuhekoi is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
