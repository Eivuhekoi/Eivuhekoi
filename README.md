Greetings people!

I'm Ikoinufe Eivuhekoi!  
Worldbuilder, coder\*, short-story writer and a dozen million other labels for all the hobbies I've tried and given up on!

(Programming) languages I know (or am interested in), in no particular order:  
* Python
  * My main language and the one I like the most, although I am aware that it may not be the most "optimal" per say. But for NLP (Natural Language Programming) it is very useful thanks to the NLTK (Natural language toolkit) module.
* Java (barely)
  * Interested in Java mainly since it feels similar Python, however I like the "strong typing" and "strong line ending" (not a thing afaik, but like having to end lines with `;`)
* Assembly x86 (just an interest!)
  * Why am I interested in x86 assembly? The reason is simple I'm (~~a fucking nerd~~) interested in the nitty-gritty of how a processor (and computers in general) on the very, very low level, and x86 (and assembly more broadly afaik) is the closest to just plain machine code that I know of.  

\* "coder" here is used loosely. I just write code and if it works it's good enough!
